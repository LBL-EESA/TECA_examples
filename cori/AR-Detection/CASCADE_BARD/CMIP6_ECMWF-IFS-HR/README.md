HighResMIP-AR-Detection
=======================
This repo contains batch scripts illustrating detecting ARs(atmospheric rivers)
in a HighResMIP dataset using [TECA](https://github.com/LBL-EESA/TECA)'s
[BARD](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2020-55)(Bayesian AR detector) detector.

The data used in this example is located on NERSC's Cori file system at:
```
/global/cfs/cdirs/m3522/cmip6/CMIP6_hrmcol/HighResMIP/CMIP6/HighResMIP/ECMWF/ECMWF-IFS-HR/highresSST-present/r1i1p1f1/6hrPlevPt
```

This HighResMIP dataset spans the year 1950 to 2014 with 7 pressure levels at a
1/2 degree spatial and 6 hourly time resolution.  There are 94964 simulated time
steps stored in 780 files which require 290 GB disk space per scalar field.

In this example IVT is calculated on the fly from horizonatal wind vector and
specific humidity, thus 870 GB was processed.

The scripts contained in this repo were used to process the above dataset using
100912 cores on 1484 KNL nodes on NERSC's Cray supercomputer Cori. The run
computed the IVT vector, its magnitude, the probability of an AR and a
segmentation of the AR probability. The run completed in 4m 1s and generated a
total of 392 GB of data.

The following scripts were used for the run.

| script name | description |
| :---- | :---- |
| [1_run_planning.sh](1_run_planning.sh) | Scans the dataset. The output is Used to determine the number of Cori nodes needed for the AR detection run. |
| [2_CASCADE_BARD_AR_detect.sh](2_CASCADE_BARD_AR_detect.sh) | Makes the run detecting ARs. |
| [HighResMIP_ECMWF...6hrPlevPt.mcf](HighResMIP_ECMWF_ECMWF-IFS-HR_highresSST-present_r1i1p1f1_6hrPlevPt.mcf) | MCF configuration file identifying the location of the HighResMIP data |

These can be used as a template for making other similar runs. One will need to
modify the paths in the scripts to point to a TECA install, and modify the MCF
file to point to the desire3d HighResMIP dataset. Also note IVT magnitude can
also be processed if it is available. This would reduce the computational and
I/O overheads.
